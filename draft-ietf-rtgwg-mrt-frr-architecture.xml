    <abstract>

      <t>With increasing deployment of Loop-Free Alternates (LFA)
      <xref target="RFC5286"/>, it is clear that a complete solution
      for IP and LDP Fast-Reroute is required.  This specification
      provides that solution.  IP/LDP Fast-Reroute with Maximally
      Redundant Trees (MRT-FRR) is a technology that gives
      link-protection and node-protection with 100% coverage in any
      network topology that is still connected after the failure.</t>

      <t>MRT removes all need to engineer for coverage.  MRT is also
      extremely computationally efficient.  For any router in the
      network, the MRT computation is less than the LFA computation
      for a node with three or more neighbors.</t>

    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>This document gives a complete solution for IP/LDP
      fast-reroute <xref target="RFC5714"/>. MRT-FRR creates two
      alternate trees separate from the primary next-hop forwarding
      used during stable operation.  These two trees are maximally
      diverse from each other, providing link and node protection for
      100% of paths and failures as long as the failure does not cut
      the network into multiple pieces.  This document defines the
      architecture for IP/LDP fast-reroute with MRT.  The associated
      protocol extensions are defined in <xref
      target="I-D.atlas-ospf-mrt"/> and <xref
      target="I-D.atlas-mpls-ldp-mrt"/>.  The exact MRT algorithm is
      defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm"/>.</t>

     <t>IP/LDP Fast-Reroute with MRT (MRT-FRR) uses two maximally
     diverse forwarding topologies to provide alternates.  A primary
     next-hop should be on only one of the diverse forwarding
     topologies; thus, the other can be used to provide an alternate.
     Once traffic has been moved to one of MRTs, it is not subject to
     further repair actions.  Thus, the traffic will not loop even if
     a worse failure (e.g. node) occurs when protection was only
     available for a simpler failure (e.g. link).</t>

     <t>In addition to supporting IP and LDP unicast fast-reroute, the
     diverse forwarding topologies and guarantee of 100% coverage
     permit fast-reroute technology to be applied to multicast traffic
     as described in <xref target="I-D.atlas-rtgwg-mrt-mc-arch"/>.</t>

      <t>Other existing or proposed solutions are partial solutions
      or have significant issues, as described below.</t>

        <t hangText="Loop-Free Alternates (LFA): "> LFAs <xref
        target="RFC5286"/> provide limited topology-dependent coverage
        for link and node protection.  Restrictions on choice of
        alternates can be relaxed to improve coverage, but this can
        cause forwarding loops if a worse failure is experienced than
        protected against.  Augmenting a network to provide better
        coverage is NP-hard <xref target="LFARevisited"/>.  <xref
        target="RFC6571"/> discusses the applicability of LFA to
        different topologies with a focus on common PoP
        architectures.</t>
     
        <t hangText="Remote LFA: " > Remote LFAs <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa"/> improve coverage over
        LFAs for link protection but still cannot guarantee complete
        coverage.  The trade-off of looping traffic to improve
        coverage is still made.  Remote LFAs can provide
        node-protection <xref
        target="I-D.psarkar-rtgwg-rlfa-node-protection"/> but not
        guaranteed coverage and the computation required is quite high
        (an SPF for each PQ-node evaluated). <xref
        target="I-D.bryant-ipfrr-tunnels"/> describes additional
        mechanisms to further improve coverage, at the cost of added
        complexity.</t>

        <t hangText="Not-Via: ">Not-Via <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ipfrr-notvia-addresses"/> is the only
        other solution that provides 100% coverage for link and node
        failures and does not have potential looping.  However, the
        computation is very high (an SPF per failure point) and
        academic implementations <xref target="LightweightNotVia"/>
        have found the address management complexity to be high.</t>
        </list></t>

<section title="Importance of 100% Coverage">

<t>Fast-reroute is based upon the single failure assumption - that the
time between single failures is long enough for a network to
reconverge and start forwarding on the new shortest paths.  That does
not imply that the network will only experience one failure or change.</t>

<t> This is my second addition.</t>

<t>It is straightforward to analyze a particular network topology for
coverage.  However, a real network does not always have the same
topology.  For instance, maintenance events will take links or nodes
out of use.  Simply costing out a link can have a significant effect
on what LFAs are available. Similarly, after a single failure has
happened, the topology is changed and its associated coverage.
Finally, many networks have new routers or links added and removed;
each of those changes can have an effect on the coverage for
topology-sensitive methods such as LFA and Remote LFA.  If
fast-reroute is important for the network services provided, then a
method that guarantees 100% coverage is important to accomodate
natural network topology changes.</t>

<t>Asymmetric link costs are also a common aspect of networks.  There
are at least three common causes for them.  First, any broadcast
interface is represented by a pseudo-node and has asymmetric link
costs to and from that pseudo-node.  Second, when routers come up or a
link with LDP comes up, it is recommended in <xref target="RFC5443"/>
and <xref target="RFC3137"/> that the link metric be raised to the
maximum cost; this may not be symmetric and for <xref
target="RFC3137"/> is not expected to be.  Third, techniques such as
IGP metric tuning for traffic-engineering can result in asymmetric
link costs.  A fast-reroute solution needs to handle network
topologies with asymmetric link costs.</t>

<t>When a network needs to use a micro-loop prevention mechanism <xref
target="RFC5715"/> such as Ordered FIB<xref
target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ordered-fib"/> or Farside Tunneling<xref
target="RFC5715"/>, then the whole IGP area needs to have alternates
available so that the micro-loop prevention mechanism, which requires
slower network convergence, can take the necessary time without
adversely impacting traffic.  Without complete coverage, traffic to the
unprotected destinations will be dropped for significantly longer than
with current convergence - where routers individually converge as fast
as possible.</t>

</section>

<section title="Partial Deployment and Backwards Compatibility">

<t>MRT-FRR supports partial deployment.  As with many new features,
the protocols (OSPF, LDP, ISIS) indicate their capability to support
MRT.  Inside the MRT-capable connected group of routers (referred to
as an MRT Island), the MRTs are computed.  Alternates to destinations
outside the MRT Island are computed and depend upon the existence of a
loop-free neighbor of the MRT Island for that destination.</t>

<section title="Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT)">

<t>A pair of Maximally Redundant Trees is a pair of directed spanning trees
that provides maximally disjoint paths towards their common root.  Only
links or nodes whose failure would partition the network
(i.e. cut-links and cut-vertices) are shared between the trees.  The
algorithm to compute MRTs is given in <xref
target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm"/>.  This algorithm can be
computed in O(e + n log n); it is less than three SPFs.  Modeling
results comparing the alternate path lengths obtained with MRT to 
other approaches are described in <xref
target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm"/>.  This document
describes how the MRTs can be used and not how to compute them.</t>

<t>MRT provides destination-based trees for each destination.  Each
router stores its normal primary next-hop(s) as well as MRT-Blue
next-hop(s) and MRT-Red next-hop(s) toward each destination.  The
alternate will be selected between the MRT-Blue and MRT-Red.</t>

<t>The most important thing to understand about MRTs is that for each
pair of destination-routed MRTs, there is a path from every node X to
the destination D on the Blue MRT that is as disjoint as possible from
the path on the Red MRT.</t> 

<t>For example, in <xref target="fig_example_2_connected"/>, there is
a network graph that is 2-connected in (a) and associated MRTs in (b)
and (c).  One can consider the paths from B to R; on the Blue MRT, the
paths are B-&gt;F-&gt;D-&gt;E-&gt;R or B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;E-&gt;R.  On
the Red MRT, the path is B-&gt;A-&gt;R.  These are clearly link and
node-disjoint.  These MRTs are redundant trees because the paths are
disjoint.</t>

<section anchor="mrt_and_frr" title="Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT) and Fast-Reroute">

<t>In normal IGP routing, each router has its shortest-path-tree to
all destinations.  From the perspective of a particular destination,
D, this looks like a reverse SPT (rSPT).  To use maximally redundant
trees, in addition, each destination D has two MRTs associated with
it; by convention these will be called the MRT-Blue and MRT-Red.
MRT-FRR is realized by using multi-topology forwarding.  There is a
MRT-Blue forwarding topology and a MRT-Red forwarding topology.</t>

<t>Any IP/LDP fast-reroute technique beyond LFA requires an additional
dataplane procedure, such as an additional forwarding mechanism.  The
well-known options are multi-topology forwarding (used by MRT-FRR),
tunneling (e.g. <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ipfrr-notvia-addresses"/>
or <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa"/>), and per-interface
forwarding (e.g. Loop-Free Failure Insensitive Routing in <xref
target="EnyediThesis"/>).</t>

<t>When there is a link or node failure affecting, but not
partitioning, the network, each node will still have at least one path
via one of the MRTs to reach the destination D.  For example, in <xref
target="Non-2-connected_Network_Example"/>, C would normally forward
traffic to R across the C&lt;-&gt;R link.  If that C&lt;-&gt;R link
fails, then C could use the Blue MRT path C-&gt;D-&gt;E-&gt;R.</t>

<t>As is always the case with fast-reroute technologies, forwarding
does not change until a local failure is detected.  Packets are
forwarded along the shortest path.  The appropriate alternate to use
is pre-computed.  <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm"/>
describes exactly how to determine whether the MRT-Blue next-hops or
the MRT-Red next-hops should be the MRT alternate next-hops for a
particular primary next-hop to a particular destination.</t>

<t>MRT alternates are always available to use.  It is a local decision
whether to use an MRT alternate, a Loop-Free Alternate or some other
type of alternate.</t>

<t>As described in <xref target="RFC5286"/>, when a worse failure than
is anticipated happens, using LFAs that are not downstream neighbors
can cause micro-looping.  Section 1.1 of <xref target="RFC5286"/>
gives an example of link-protecting alternates causing a loop on node
failure.  Even if a worse failure than anticipated happens, the use of
MRT alternates will not cause looping.  Therefore, while
node-protecting LFAs may be preferred, the certainty that no
alternate-induced looping will occur is an advantage of using MRT
alternates when the available node-protecting LFA is not a downstream
path.</t>

<section anchor="sec_uni_forwarding" title="Unicast Forwarding with MRT Fast-Reroute">
<t>As mentioned before, MRT FRR needs multi-topology
forwarding.  Unfortunately, neither IP nor LDP provides extra bits for
a packet to indicate its topology.  Once the MRTs are computed, 
the two sets of MRTs can be used as two additional forwarding topologies.  The same
considerations apply for forwarding along the MRTs as for handling
multiple topologies.</t>

<t> There are three possible types of routers involved in forwarding 
a packet along an MRT path.  At the MRT ingress router, the packet 
leaves the shortest path to the destination and follows an 
MRT path to the destination.  In a FRR application, the MRT ingress 
router is the PLR.  An MRT transit router takes a packet that arrives already
associated with the particular MRT, and forwards it on that same MRT.
In some situations (to be discussed later), the packet will need 
to leave the MRT path and return
to the shortest path.  This takes place at the MRT egress router.
The MRT ingress and egress 
functionality may depend on the underlying type of packet being 
forwarded (LDP or IP).  The MRT transit functionality is independent
of the type of packet being forwarded.  We first consider several MRT 
transit forwarding mechanisms.  Then we look at how these forwarding 
mechanisms can be applied to carrying LDP and IP traffic.</t>

<section anchor="sec_mrt_forwarding_mechanisms" title="MRT Forwarding Mechanisms">

<t> The following options for MRT forwarding mechanisms are considered.</t>

<t> 
<list style="numbers">
<t>MRT LDP Labels

<list style="letters">
<t> Topology-scoped FEC encoded using a single label</t>
<t> Topology and FEC encoded using a two label stack</t>

<t> MRT IPv4 Tunnels</t>
<t> MRT IPv6 Tunnels</t>
</list>
</t>
</list>
</t>

<section title="MRT LDP labels">

<t> We consider two options for the MRT forwarding mechanisms using MRT LDP labels.</t>

<section anchor="sec_option_1a" title="Topology-scoped FEC encoded using a single label (Option 1A)">
<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-multi-topology"/> provides a mechanism to 
distribute FEC-Label bindings scoped to a given topology 
(represented by MT-ID).  To use multi-topology LDP to create MRT 
forwarding topologies, we associate two MT-IDs with the MRT-Red and MRT-Blue 
forwarding topologies, in addition to the default shortest path
forwarding topology with MT-ID=0.</t>

<t> With this forwarding mechanism, a single label is distributed for 
each topology-scoped FEC.  For a given FEC in the default topology (call it default-FEC-A), 
two additional topology-scoped FECs would be created, corresponding to the Red 
and Blue MRT forwarding topologies (call them red-FEC-A and blue-FEC-A).
A router supporting this MRT transit forwarding mechanism advertises a 
different FEC-label binding for each of the three topology-scoped FECs. 
When a packet is received with a label corresponding to red-FEC-A (for example),
an MRT transit router will determine the  
next-hop for the MRT-Red forwarding topology for that FEC, swap the incoming label with
the outgoing label corresponding to red-FEC-A learned from the MRT-Red next-hop router,
and forward the packet. </t>

<t>This forwarding mechanism has the useful property that the FEC
associated with the packet is maintained in the labels at each hop along the MRT. We will 
take advantage of this property when specifying how to carry LDP traffic on MRT paths 
using multi-topology LDP labels.</t>

<t>This approach is very simple for hardware to
support. However, it reduces the label space for other uses, and it
increases the memory needed to store the labels and the communication
required by LDP to distribute FEC-label bindings.</t>

<t> This forwarding option uses the LDP signaling extensions
described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-multi-topology"/>.
The MRT-specific LDP extensions required to support this option are described in
<xref target="I-D.atlas-mpls-ldp-mrt"/>. </t>

<t> I am also proposing this additional paragraph.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="sec_option_1b" title="Topology and FEC encoded using a two label stack (Option 1B)">

<t> With this forwarding mechanism, a two label stack is used to encode the 
topology and the FEC of the packet.  The top label (topology-id label) 
identifies the MRT forwarding topology, while the second label (FEC label) identifies the FEC.
The top label would be a new FEC type with two values corresponding to MRT Red and Blue topologies.  </t>

<t> When an MRT transit router receives a packet with a topology-id label, the router pops
the top label and uses that it to guide the next-hop selection in combination with
the next label in the stack (the FEC label).  The router then swaps the FEC label, using the FEC-label bindings learned through normal LDP mechanisms.  The router then pushes the topology-id label for the next-hop.</t>

<t>As with Option 1A, this forwarding mechanism also has the useful property that the FEC
associated with the packet is maintained in the labels at each hop along the MRT.</t>

<t>This forwarding mechanism has minimal usage of additional labels, memory and
LDP communication.  It does increase the size of packets and the
complexity of the required label operations and look-ups.  </t>

<t> This forwarding option is consistent with context-specific label spaces, 
as described in [RFC 5331].  However, the precise LDP behavior required to support this 
option for MRT has not been specified.</t>
</section>

<section title="Compatibility of Option 1A and 1B">
<t>  In principle, MRT transit forwarding mechanisms 1A and 1B can coexist in the 
same network, with a packet being forwarding along a single MRT path using 
the single label of option 1A for some hops and the two label stack of
option 1B for other hops.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Mandatory support for MRT LDP Label option 1A">
<t>  If a router supports a profile that includes the MRT LDP Label option 
for MRT transit forwarding mechanism, then it MUST support option 1A, which encodes
topology-scoped FECs using a single label.  
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="MRT IP tunnels (Options 2A and 2B)">
<t> IP tunneling can also be used as an MRT transit forwarding 
mechanism.  Each router supporting this MRT transit forwarding mechanism
announces two additional loopback addresses and their
associated MRT color.  Those addresses are used as destination
addresses for MRT-blue and MRT-red IP tunnels respectively.  The 
special loopback addresses
allow the transit nodes to identify the traffic as being forwarded
along either the MRT-blue or MRT-red topology to reach the tunnel
destination.  Announcements of these two additional loopback
addresses per router with their MRT color requires IGP extensions,
which have not been defined.</t>

<t> Either IPv4 (option 2A) or IPv6 (option 2B) can be 
used as the tunneling mechanism.</t>

<t>Note that the two forwarding mechanisms using LDP Label options do not require
additional loopbacks per router, as is required by the IP tunneling
mechanism. This is because LDP
labels are used on a hop-by-hop basis to identify MRT-blue and MRT-red
forwarding topologies.</t>



</section>

</section>



<section anchor="sec_ldp_uni_forward" title="Forwarding LDP Unicast Traffic over MRT Paths">



<t>In the previous section, we examined several options for providing 
MRT transit forwarding functionality, which is independent of the type of traffic 
being carried.  We now look at the MRT ingress functionality, which 
will depend on the type of traffic being carried (IP or LDP). We start by considering
LDP traffic. </t>

<t>We also simplify the initial discussion by assuming that the network consists 
of a single IGP area, and that all routers in the network participate in MRT.
Other deployment scenarios that require MRT egress functionality
are considered later in this document.</t>

<t>In principle, it is possible to carry LDP traffic in MRT IP tunnels.
However, for LDP traffic, it is very desirable to avoid tunneling.  
Tunneling LDP traffic to a remote node requires knowledge of remote 
FEC-label bindings so that the LDP traffic can continue
to be forwarded properly when it leaves the tunnel. This requires 
targeted LDP sessions which can add management complexity.
The two MRT LDP Label forwarding mechanisms have the useful property that the FEC
associated with the packet is maintained in the labels at each hop along the MRT, 
as long as an MRT to the originator of the FEC is used.  The MRT IP tunneling mechanism 
does not have this useful property.  Therefore, this document only considers the
two MRT LDP Label forwarding mechanisms 
for protecting LDP traffic with MRT fast-reroute. 
</t>

<section title="Forwarding LDP traffic using MRT LDP Labels (Option 1A)">
<t> The MRT LDP Label option 1A forwarding mechanism uses topology-scoped FECs
encoded using a single label as described in section 
<xref target="sec_option_1a"/>.  When a PLR 
receives an LDP packet that needs to be forwarded on the Red MRT (for example), 
it does a label swap operation, replacing the usual 
LDP label for the FEC with the Red MRT label 
for that FEC received from the next-hop router in the Red MRT computed by the PLR.  
When the next-hop router in the Red MRT receives the 
packet with the Red MRT label for the FEC, the MRT transit forwarding 
functionality continues as described in 
<xref target="sec_option_1a"/>.
In this way the original FEC associated with the packet is maintained 
at each hop along the MRT. </t>
</section>

<section title="Forwarding LDP traffic using MRT LDP Labels (Option 1B)">
<t>The MRT LDP Label option 1B forwarding mechanism encodes the topology
and the FEC using a two label stack as described in
<xref target="sec_option_1b"/>. 
When a PLR 
receives an LDP packet that needs to be forwarded on the Red MRT, 
it first does a normal LDP label swap operation, replacing the incoming
normal LDP label associated with a given FEC with the outgoing
normal LDP label for that FEC learned from 
the next-hop on the Red MRT.  In addition, the PLR pushes
the topology-identification label associated with the Red MRT,
and forward the packet to the appropriate next-hop on the 
Red MRT.  When the next-hop router in the Red MRT receives the 
packet with the Red MRT label for the FEC, the MRT transit forwarding 
functionality continues as described in 
<xref target="sec_option_1b"/>.
As with option 1A, the original FEC associated with the packet is maintained 
at each hop along the MRT.</t> 
</section>

<section title="Other considerations for forwarding LDP traffic using MRT LDP Labels ">

<t> Note that forwarding LDP traffic using MRT LDP Labels
requires that an MRT to the originator of the FEC be used.
For example, one might find it desirable to have the PLR use an MRT 
to reach the primary next-next-hop for the FEC, and then continue 
forwarding the LDP packet along the shortest path tree from the primary next-next-hop.
However, this would require tunneling to the primary next-next-hop and 
a targeted LDP session for the PLR to learn the  
FEC-label binding for primary next-next-hop to correctly forward 
the packet.</t>

<t>For greatest hardware compatibility, routers implementing 
MRT fast-reroute of LDP traffic
MUST support Option 1A of encoding the MT-ID in the
labels (See <xref target="sec_proto_ldp"/>). </t>
</section>


</section>

<section title="Forwarding IP Unicast Traffic over MRT Paths">

<t>For IP traffic, there is no currently practical alternative except
tunneling to gain the bits needed to indicate the MRT-Blue or MRT-Red
forwarding topology.  The choice of tunnel egress MAY be flexible
since any router closer to the destination than the next-hop can work.
This architecture assumes that the original destination in the area is
selected (see <xref target="sec_multi_homed_prefixes"/> for handling
of multi-homed prefixes); another possible choice is the next-next-hop
towards the destination.  As discussed in the previous section, 
for LDP traffic, using the MRT to the original
destination simplifies MRT-FRR by avoiding the need for targeted LDP
sessions to the next-next-hop.  For IP, that consideration doesn't
apply.  However, consistency with LDP is RECOMMENDED.</t>

<t>  Some situations require tunneling IP traffic along an MRT 
to a tunnel endpoint that is not the destination of the IP traffic.
These situations will be discussed in detail later.  We note
here that an IP packet with a destination in a different IGP area/level 
from the PLR should be tunneled on 
the MRT to the ABR/LBR on the shortest path 
to the destination.  For a destination outside of the PLR's
MRT Island, the packet should be tunneled on the MRT to a 
non-proxy-node immediately before the named proxy-node on 
that particular color MRT.
</t> 

<section title="Tunneling IP traffic using MRT LDP Labels">
<t>An IP packet can be tunneled along an MRT path by pushing
the appropriate MRT LDP label(s).  Tunneling using LDP labels, 
as opposed to IP headers, has the the advantage that more
installed routers can do line-rate encapsulation 
and decapsulation using LDP than using IP. 
Also, no additional IP addresses would need to be allocated or
signaled.</t> 

<section title="Tunneling IP traffic using MRT LDP Labels (Option 1A)">
<t>The MRT LDP Label option 1A forwarding mechanism uses topology-scoped FECs
encoded using a single label as described in section 
<xref target="sec_option_1a"/>.  When a PLR 
receives an IP packet that needs to be forwarded on the Red MRT
to a particular tunnel endpoint, 
it does a label push operation.  The label pushed is 
the Red MRT label for a FEC originated by the tunnel endpoint, learned from the next-hop on the Red MRT.
</t> 
</section>

<section title="Tunneling IP traffic using MRT LDP Labels (Option 1B)">
<t>The MRT LDP Label option 1B forwarding mechanism encodes the topology
and the FEC using a two label stack as described in
<xref target="sec_option_1b"/>.   When a PLR 
receives an IP packet that needs to be forwarded on the Red MRT
to a particular tunnel endpoint, 
the PLR pushes two labels on the IP packet.
The first (inner) label is the normal LDP label 
learned from the next-hop on the Red MRT, associated 
with a FEC originated by the tunnel endpoint.  The second (outer)
label is the topology-identification label associated with the Red MRT.
</t>

<t>  For completeness, we note here a potential optimization.  In order to tunnel  
an IP packet over an MRT to the destination of the IP packet (as opposed
to an arbitrary tunnel endpoint), then we could just push a 
topology-identification label directly onto the packet.  An MRT transit 
router would need to pop the topology-id label, do an IP route lookup 
in the context of that topology-id , and push the topology-id label.
</t> 

</section>
</section>


<section title="Tunneling IP traffic using MRT IP Tunnels">
<t>In order to tunnel over the MRT to a particular tunnel endpoint, the PLR 
encapsulates the original IP packet with an additional IP header using 
the MRT-Blue or MRT-Red loopack address of the tunnel endpoint.</t>


</section>

<section title="Required support"> 

<t>For greatest hardware compatibility
and ease in removing the MRT-topology marking at area/level
boundaries, routers that support MPLS and implement IP MRT
fast-reroute MUST support tunneling of IP traffic using 
MRT LDP Labels Option 1A (topology-scoped FEC encoded 
using a single label). </t>

</section>

</section>
</section>

<section anchor="sec_island" title="MRT Island Formation">

<t> The purpose of communicating support for MRT in the IGP is to indicate that the
MRT-Blue and MRT-Red forwarding topologies are created for transit
traffic.  The MRT architecture allows for different, potentially 
incompatible options.  In order to create constistent MRT forwarding topologies, 
the routers participating in a particular MRT Island need to use the same set of options.  These
options are grouped into MRT profiles.  In addition, the routers in an MRT Island all need 
to use the same set of nodes and links within the Island when computing the MRT forwarding
topologies.  This section describes the information used by a router to determine
the nodes and links to include in a particular MRT Island.  Some of this information is 
shared among routers using the newly-defined IGP signaling extensions for MRT described in 
<xref target="I-D.atlas-ospf-mrt"/> and <xref target="I-D.li-isis-mrt"/>.  Other 
information already exists in the IGPs and can be used by MRT in Island formation, subject 
to the interpretation defined here.</t>

<t> Deployment scenarios using multi-topology OSPF or IS-IS, or running both ISIS and OSPF on the
same routers is out of scope for this specification.  
As with LFA, it is expected that OSPF Virtual Links will not be supported.</t>

<section title="IGP Area or Level">
<t> All links in an MRT Island MUST be bidirectional 
and belong to the same IGP area or level.  For ISIS, a link belonging 
to both level 1 and level 2 would qualify to be in multiple MRT Islands.  
A given ABR or LBR can belong to multiple MRT Islands, 
corresponding to the areas or levels in which it participates.  
Inter-area forwarding behavior is discussed in  <xref target="sec_abr_forwarding"/>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Support for a specific MRT profile">
<t> All routers in an MRT Island MUST support the same MRT profile.  
A router advertises support for a given MRT profile 
using the IGP extensions defined in <xref target="I-D.atlas-ospf-mrt"/> and
 <xref target="I-D.li-isis-mrt"/> using an 8-bit Profile ID value.  
 A given router can support multiple 
 MRT profiles and participate in multiple MRT Islands.  
 The options that make up an MRT profile, as well as the
default MRT profile, are defined in  <xref target="sec_mrt_profile"/>.  </t> 

</section>

<section title="Excluding additional routers and interfaces from the MRT Island">

<t> 
MRT takes into account existing IGP 
mechanisms for discouraging traffic from using particular links and routers, and 
it introduces an MRT-specific exclusion mechanism for links.
</t>

<section title="Existing IGP exclusion mechanisms">
<t> Mechanisms for discouraging traffic from using particular links
already exist in ISIS and OSPF.  In ISIS, an interface configured with a
metric of 2^24-2 (0xFFFFFE) will only be used as a last resort.
(An interface configured with a metric of 2^24-1 (0xFFFFFF) will not be advertised 
into the topology.)  In OSPF, an interface configured with a metric of 2^16-1 (0xFFFF)
will only be used as a last resort.  These metrics can be configured manually
to enforce administrative policy, or they can be set in an automated manner as with
LDP IGP synchronization [RFC5443].  
</t>

<t> 
Mechanisms also exist in ISIS and OSPF to prevent transit traffic from using a particular router.
In ISIS, the overload bit is used for this purpose.  In OSPF, [RFC3137] specifies setting all outgoing
interface metrics to 0xFFFF to accomplish this.
</t>

<t> 
The following rules for MRT Island formation ensure that MRT FRR protection 
traffic does not use a link or router that is discouraged from carrying traffic 
by existing IGP mechanisms.

<list style="numbers">
<t> A bidirectional link MUST be excluded from an MRT Island if either the
forward or reverse cost on the link is 0xFFFFFE (for ISIS) or 0xFFFF for OSPF.</t>
<t> A router MUST be excluded from an MRT Island if it is advertised with the overload 
bit set (for ISIS), or it is advertised with metric values of 0xFFFF on all of its 
outgoing interfaces (for OSPF).</t>
</list>

</section>

<section title="MRT-specific exclusion mechanism">
<t> 
This architecture also defines a means of excluding an otherwise usable link from MRT Islands. 
<xref target="I-D.atlas-ospf-mrt"/> and
 <xref target="I-D.li-isis-mrt"/> define the IGP extensions for OSPF and ISIS used to advertise that
 a link is MRT-Ineligible.  A link with either interface advertised as MRT-Ineligible MUST

<section anchor= "sec_abr_forwarding" title="Inter-area Forwarding Behavior">

<t>Unless otherwise specified, in this section 
we will use the terms area and ABR to indicate either 
an OSPF area and OSPF ABR or ISIS level and ISIS LBR.</t>

<t>An ABR/LBR has two forwarding roles.  First, it forwards traffic
within areas.  Second, it forwards traffic from one area into
another.  These same two roles apply for MRT transit traffic.  Traffic
on MRT-Red or MRT-Blue destined inside the area needs to stay on
MRT-Red or MRT-Blue in that area.  However, it is desirable for
traffic leaving the area to also exit MRT-Red or MRT-Blue and return to
shortest path forwarding.</t>

<t>For unicast MRT-FRR, the need to stay on an MRT forwarding topology
terminates at the ABR/LBR whose best route is via a different
area/level.  It is highly desirable to go back to the default
forwarding topology when leaving an area/level.  There are three basic
reasons for this.  First, the default topology uses shortest paths;
the packet will thus take the shortest possible route to the
destination.  Second, this allows failures that might appear in
multiple areas (e.g. ABR/LBR failures) to be separately identified and
repaired around.  Third, the packet can be fast-rerouted again, if
necessary, due to a failure in a different area.</t>

<t>An ABR/LBR that receives a packet on MRT-Red or MRT-Blue towards 
destination Z should continue to forward the packet along MRT-Red
or MRT-Blue only if the best route to Z is in the same area as the interface 
that the packet was received on.  Otherwise, the packet
should be removed from MRT-Red or MRT-Blue and forwarded on the
shortest-path default forwarding topology.</t>

<t>To avoid per-interface forwarding state for MRT-Red and MRT-Blue,
the ABR/LBR needs to arrange that packets destined to a different area
arrive at the ABR/LBR already not marked as MRT-Red or MRT-Blue.</t>

<section title="ABR Forwarding Behavior with MRT LDP Label Option 1A">
<t>For LDP forwarding where a single label specifies (MT-ID, FEC), the
ABR/LBR is responsible for advertising the proper label to each
neighbor.  Assume that an ABR/LBR has allocated three labels for a
particular destination; those labels are L_primary, L_blue, and L_red.
To those routers in the same area as the best route to the destination,
the ABR/LBR advertises the following FEC-label bindings: 
L_primary for the default topology, L_blue for the MRT-Blue MT-ID
and L_red for the MRT-Red MT-ID, as expected.
However, to routers in other areas, 
the ABR/LBR advertises the following FEC-label bindings:
L_primary for the default topology, and
L_primary for the Rainbow MRT MT-ID.  Associating 
L_primary with the Rainbow MRT MT-ID causes the receiving 
routers to use L_primary for the MRT-Blue MT-ID and for 
the MRT-Red MT-ID.</t>

<t>The ABR/LBR installs all next-hops for the best area: primary
next-hops for L_primary, MRT-Blue next-hops for L_blue, and MRT-Red
next-hops for L_red.  Because the ABR/LBR advertised (Rainbow MRT
MT-ID, FEC) with L_primary to neighbors not in the best area, packets
from those neighbors will arrive at the ABR/LBR with a label L_primary
and will be forwarded into the best area along the default topology.
By controlling what labels are advertised, the ABR/LBR can thus
enforce that packets exiting the area do so on the shortest-path
default topology.</t>

<section title="Motivation for Creating the Rainbow-FEC">
<t> The desired forwarding behavior could be achieved in the above example 
without using the Rainbow-FEC. This could be done by having the 
ABR/LBR advertise the following 
FEC-label bindings to neighbors not in the best area:
L1_primary for the default topology, L1_primary for the MRT-Blue MT-ID, 
and L1_primary for the MRT-Red MT-ID.  Doing this would require machinery
to spoof the labels used in FEC-label binding advertisements on a 
per-neighbor basis.  Such label-spoofing machinery does not currently
exist in most LDP implmentations and doesn't have other obvious uses.
</t>

<t>Many existing LDP implmentations do however have the ability to filter
FEC-label binding advertisements on a per-neighbor basis. The Rainbow-FEC 
allows us to re-use the existing per-neighbor FEC filtering machinery 
to achieve the desired result.  By introducing the Rainbow FEC, we can use 
per-neighbor FEC-filtering machinery to advertise the FEC-label binding for the 
Rainbow-FEC (and filter those for MRT-Blue and MRT-Red) to non-best-area
neighbors of the ABR.</t>

<t>The use of the Rainbow-FEC by the ABR for non-best-area
advertisements is RECOMMENDED.  An ABR MAY advertise the label 
for the default topology in separate MRT-Blue and MRT-Red advertisements.
However, a router that supports the LDP Label MRT Forwarding Mechanism 
MUST be able to receive and correctly interpret the Rainbow-FEC.  
 </t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="ABR Forwarding Behavior with IP Tunneling (option 2)">

<t>If IP tunneling is used, then the ABR/LBR behavior is dependent
upon the outermost IP address.  If the outermost IP address is an MRT
loopback address of the ABR/LBR, then the packet is decapsulated and
forwarded based upon the inner IP address, which should go on the
default SPT topology.  If the outermost IP address is not an MRT
loopback address of the ABR/LBR, then the packet is simply forwarded
along the associated forwarding topology.  A PLR sending traffic to a
destination outside its local area/level will pick the MRT and use the
associated MRT loopback address of the selected ABR/LBR advertising the 
lowest cost to the external destination.</t>

<t>Thus, for these two MRT Forwarding Mechanisms( MRT LDP Label 
option 1A and IP tunneling option 2), there is 
no need for additional computation or per-area forwarding state.</t>

</section>

<section title="ABR Forwarding Behavior with LDP Label option 1B">
<t>The other MRT forwarding mechanism described in <xref
target="sec_uni_forwarding"/> uses two labels, a topology-id label,
and a FEC-label.  
This mechanism would require that any router whose MRT-Red or MRT-Blue
next-hop is an ABR/LBR would need to determine whether the ABR/LBR
would forward the packet out of the area/level.  If so, then that
router should pop off the topology-identification label before
forwarding the packet to the ABR/LBR.</t>

<t> For example, in <xref target="fig_abr_mrt"/>, if node H fails,
node E has to put traffic towards prefix p onto MRT-Red.  But since
node D knows that ABR1 will use a best route from another area, it is safe
for D to pop the Topology-Identification Label and just forward the
packet to ABR1 along the MRT-Red next-hop.  ABR1 will use the shortest
path in Area 10.</t>

<t>In all cases for ISIS and most cases for OSPF, the penultimate
router can determine what decision the adjacent ABR will make.  The
one case where it can't be determined is when two ASBRs are in
different non-backbone areas attached to the same ABR, then the ASBR's
Area ID may be needed for tie-breaking (prefer the route with the
largest OPSF area ID) and the Area ID isn't announced as part of the
ASBR link-state advertisement (LSA).  In this one case, suboptimal
forwarding along the MRT in the other area would happen.  If that
becomes a realistic deployment scenario, OSPF extensions could be
considered.  This is not covered in <xref
target="I-D.atlas-ospf-mrt"/>.</t>

<section anchor="sec_multi_homed_prefixes" title="Prefixes Multiply Attached to the MRT Island">

<t>How a computing router S determines its local MRT Island for each
supported MRT profile is already discussed in <xref
target="sec_island"/>.</t>

<t>There are two types of prefixes or FECs that may be multiply
attached to an MRT Island.  The first type are multi-homed prefixes
that usually connect at a domain or protocol boundary.  The second
type represent routers that do not support the profile for the MRT
Island.  The key difference is whether the traffic, once out of the
MRT Island, remains in the same area/level and might reenter the MRT
Island if a loop-free exit point is not selected.</t>

<t>FRR using LFA has the useful property that it is able 
to protect multi-homed prefixes against ABR failure. For instance, if
a prefix from the backbone is available via both ABR A and ABR B, if A
fails, then the traffic should be redirected to B. This can be 
accomplished with MRT FRR as well.</t>

<t>If ASBR protection is desired, this has additional complexities if
the ASBRs are in different areas.  Similarly, protecting labeled BGP
traffic in the event of an ASBR failure has additional complexities
due to the per-ASBR label spaces involved.</t>

<t>As discussed in <xref target="RFC5286"/>, a multi-homed prefix could be:
<list style="symbols">
<t>An out-of-area prefix announced by more than one ABR,</t>
<t>An AS-External route announced by 2 or more ASBRs,</t>
<t>A prefix with iBGP multipath to different ASBRs,</t>
<t>etc.</t>
</list></t>

<t>There are also two different approaches to protection.  The first
is tunnel endpoint selection where the 
PLR picks a router to tunnel to where that
router is loop-free with respect to the failure-point.  Conceptually,
the set of candidate routers to provide LFAs expands to all routers
that can be reached via an MRT alternate, attached to the prefix.</t> 

<t>The second is to use a proxy-node, that can be named via MPLS label
or IP address, and pick the appropriate label or IP address to reach
it on either MRT-Blue or MRT-Red as appropriate to avoid the failure
point.  A proxy-node can represent a destination prefix that can be
attached to the MRT Island via at least two routers.  It is termed a
named proxy-node if there is a way that traffic can be encapsulated to
reach specifically that proxy-node; this could be because there is an
LDP FEC for the associated prefix or because MRT-Red and MRT-Blue IP
addresses are advertised in an as-yet undefined fashion for that
proxy-node.  Traffic to a named proxy-node may take a different path
than traffic to the attaching router; traffic is also explicitly
forwarded from the attaching router along a predetermined interface
towards the relevant prefixes.</t>


<t>For IP traffic, multi-homed prefixes can use tunnel endpoint selection.
For IP traffic that is destined to a router outside the MRT Island, if
that router is the egress for a FEC advertised into the MRT Island,
then the named proxy-node approach can be used.</t>

<t>For LDP traffic, there is always a FEC advertised into the MRT
Island.  The named proxy-node approach should be used, unless the computing
router S knows the label for the FEC at the selected tunnel endpoint.</t>

<t>If a FEC is advertised from outside the MRT Island into the MRT
Island and the forwarding mechanism specified in the profile includes
LDP, then the routers learning that FEC MUST also advertise labels for
(MRT-Red, FEC) and (MRT-Blue, FEC) to neighbors inside the MRT Island.
Any router receiving a FEC
corresponding to a router outside the MRT Island or to a multi-homed
prefix MUST compute and install the transit MRT-Blue and MRT-Red
next-hops for that FEC.  The FEC-label bindings for the topology-scoped
FECs ((MT-ID 0, FEC),
(MRT-Red, FEC), and (MRT-Blue, FEC)) MUST also be provided via LDP to
neighbors inside the MRT Island.</t>

<section title="Protecting Multi-Homed Prefixes using Tunnel Endpoint Selection">

<t>Tunnel endpoint selection is a local matter for a router in the MRT Island
since it pertains to selecting and using an alternate and does not
affect the transit MRT-Red and MRT-Blue forwarding topologies. </t>

<t>Let the computing router be S and the next-hop F be the node whose
failure is to be avoided.  Let the destination be prefix p.  Have A be
the router to which the prefix p is attached for S's shortest path to
p. </t>

<t>The candidates for tunnel endpoint selection are those to which the
destination prefix is attached in the area/level.  For a particular
candidate B, it is necessary to determine if B is loop-free to reach p
with respect to S and F for node-protection or at least with respect
to S and the link (S, F) for link-protection.  If B will always prefer
to send traffic to p via a different area/level, then this is
definitional.  Otherwise, distance-based computations are necessary
and an SPF from B's perspective may be necessary.  The following
equations give the checks needed; the rationale is similar to that
given in <xref target="RFC5286"/>.</t>

<t>Loop-Free for S:   D_opt(B, p) &lt; D_opt(B, S) + D_opt(S, p)</t>
<t>Loop-Free for F:   D_opt(B, p) &lt; D_opt(B, F) + D_opt(F, p)</t>

<t>The latter is equivalent to the following, which avoids the need to
compute the shortest path from F to p.</t>

<t>Loop-Free for F:   D_opt(B, p) &lt; D_opt(B, F) + D_opt(S, p) - D_opt(S, F)</t>


<t>Finally, the rules for Endpoint selection are given below.  The
basic idea is to repair to the prefix-advertising router selected for the
shortest-path and only to select and tunnel to a different endpoint if
necessary (e.g. A=F or F is a cut-vertex or the link (S,F) is a
cut-link).</t>

<t><list style="numbers">

<t>Does S have a node-protecting alternate to A?  If so, select that.
Tunnel the packet to A along that alternate. For example, if LDP is
the forwarding mechanism, then push the label (MRT-Red, A) or
(MRT-Blue, A) onto the packet. </t>

<t>If not, then is there a router B that is loop-free to reach p while
avoiding both F and S?  If so, select B as the end-point.  Determine
the MRT alternate to reach B while avoiding F.  Tunnel the packet to B
along that alternate.  For example, with LDP, push the label (MRT-Red,
B) or (MRT-Blue, B) onto the packet.</t>

<t>If not, then does S have a link-protecting alternate to A?  If so,
select that.</t>

<t>If not, then is there a router B that is loop-free to reach p while
avoiding S and the link from S to F?  If so, select B as the endpoint
and the MRT alternate for reaching B from S that avoid the link
(S,F).</t>
</list></t>

<t>The tunnel endpoint selected will receive a packet destined to itself and,
being the egress, will pop that MPLS label (or have signaled Implicit
Null) and forward based on what is underneath.  This suffices for IP
traffic since the tunnel endpoint can use the IP header of the 
original packet to continue forwarding the packet.  However, 
tunneling will not work for LDP traffic without targeted LDP sesssions 
for learning the FEC-label binding at the tunnel endpoint.</t>

</section>

<section title="Protecting Multi-Homed Prefixes using Named Proxy-Nodes">

<t> Instead, the named proxy-node method works with LDP traffic 
without the need for targeted LDP sessions.  It also has a clear advantage
over tunnel endpoint selection, in that it is
possible to explicitly forward from the MRT Island along an interface
to a loop-free island neighbor when that interface may not be a
primary next-hop.</t>

<t>A named proxy-node represents one or more destinations and, for LDP
forwarding, has a FEC associated with it that is signaled into the MRT
Island.  Therefore, it is possible to explicitly label packets to go
to (MRT-Red, FEC) or (MRT-Blue, FEC); at the border of the MRT Island,
the label will swap to meaning (MT-ID 0, FEC).  It would be possible
to have named proxy-nodes for IP forwarding, but this would require
extensions to signal two IP addresses to be associated with MRT-Red
and MRT-Blue for the proxy-node.  A named proxy-node can be uniquely
represented by the two routers in the MRT Island to which it is
connected.  The extensions to signal such IP addresses are not defined
in <xref target="I-D.atlas-ospf-mrt"/>.  The details of what
label-bindings must be originated are described in <xref
target="I-D.atlas-mpls-ldp-mrt"/>.</t>

<t>Computing the MRT next-hops to a named proxy-node and the MRT
alternate for the computing router S to avoid a particular failure
node F is straightforward.  The details of the simple
constant-time functions, Select_Proxy_Node_NHs() and
Select_Alternates_Proxy_Node(), are given in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm"/>.  A key point is that
computing these MRT next-hops and alternates can be done as new named
proxy-nodes are added or removed without requiring a new MRT
computation or impacting other existing MRT paths.  This maps very
well to, for example, how OSPFv2 [<xref target="RFC2328"/> Section 16.5]
does incremental updates for new summary-LSAs.</t>

<t>The key question is how to attach the named proxy-node to the MRT
Island; all the routers in the MRT Island MUST do this consistently.
No more than 2 routers in the MRT Island can be selected; one should
only be selected if there are no others that meet the necessary
criteria.  The named proxy-node is logically part of the
area/level.</t>

<t>There are two sources for candidate routers in the MRT Island to
connect to the named proxy-node.  The first set are those routers that
are advertising the prefix; the named-proxy-cost
assigned to each prefix-advertising router is
the announced cost to the prefix.  The second set are those routers in
the MRT Island that are connected to routers not in the MRT Island but
in the same area/level; such routers will be defined as Island Border
Routers (IBRs).  The routers connected to the IBRs that are not in the
MRT Island and are in the same area/level as the MRT island
are Island Neighbors(INs).</t>

<t>Since packets sent to the named proxy-node along MRT-Red or MRT-Blue
may come from any router inside the MRT Island, it is necessary that
whatever router to which an IBR forwards the packet be loop-free with
regard to the whole MRT Island for the destination.  Thus, an IBR is a
candidate router only if it possesses at least one IN whose shortest path to
the prefix does not enter the MRT Island.  A method for identifying
loop-free Island Neighbors(LFINs) is discussed below.  The named-proxy-cost
assigned to each (IBR, IN) pair is cost(IBR, IN) + D_opt(IN, prefix).</t>

<t>From the set of prefix-advertising routers and the set of IBRs 
with at least one LFIN, the two routers with the lowest named-proxy-cost 
are selected.  Ties are broken based upon the
lowest Router ID.  For ease of discussion, the two 
selected routers will be referred to as proxy-node attachment routers.</t>

<t>A proxy-node attachment router has a special forwarding role.  When
a packet is received destined to (MRT-Red, prefix) or (MRT-Blue,
prefix), if the proxy-node attachment router is an IBR, it MUST swap
to the default topology (e.g. swap to the label for (MT-ID 0, prefix)
or remove the outer IP encapsulation) and forward the packet to the IN
whose cost was used in the selection.  If the proxy-node attachment
router is not an IBR, then the packet MUST be removed from the MRT
forwarding topology and sent along the interface(s) that caused the
router to advertise the prefix; this interface might be out of the
area/level/AS.</t>

<section title="Computing if an Island Neighbor (IN) is loop-free">

<t>As discussed, the Island Neighbor needs to be loop-free with regard
to the whole MRT Island for the destination.  Conceptually, the cost
of transiting the MRT Island should be regarded as 0.  This can be
done by collapsing the MRT Island into a single node, as seen in <xref
target="fig_island_ext_dest"/>, and then computing SPFs from each
Island Neighbor and from the MRT Island itself.</t>

<t>The simple way to do this without manipulating the topology is to
compute the SPFs from each IN and a node in the MRT Island (e.g. the
GADAG root), but use a link metric of 0 for all links between routers
in the MRT Island.  The distances computed via SPF this way will be
refered to as Dist_mrt0.</t>

<t>An IN is loop-free with respect to a destination D if:
Dist_mrt0(IN, D) &lt; Dist_mrt0(IN, MRT Island Router) + Dist_mrt0(MRT
Island Router, D).  Any router in the MRT Island can be used since the
cost of transiting between MRT Island routers is 0.  The GADAG Root is
recommended for consistency.</t>

</section>

<section title="MRT Alternates for Destinations Outside the MRT Island">

<t>A natural concern with new functionality is how to have it be
useful when it is not deployed across an entire IGP area.  In the case
of MRT FRR, where it provides alternates when appropriate LFAs aren't
available, there are also deployment scenarios where it may make sense
to only enable some routers in an area with MRT FRR.  A simple example
of such a scenario would be a ring of 6 or more routers that is
connected via two routers to the rest of the area.</t>

<t>Destinations inside the local island can obviously use MRT
alternates.  Destinations outside the local island can be treated like
a multi-homed prefix and either Endpoint Selection or Named
Proxy-Nodes can be used.  Named Proxy-Nodes MUST be supported when LDP
forwarding is supported and a label-binding for the destination is
sent to an IBR.</t>

<t>Naturally, there are more complicated options to improve coverage,
such as connecting multiple MRT islands across tunnels, but the need
for the additional complexity has not been justified.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Network Convergence and Preparing for the Next Failure">

<t>After a failure, MRT detours ensure that packets reach their
intended destination while the IGP has not reconverged onto the new
topology.  As link-state updates reach the routers, the IGP process
calculates the new shortest paths. Two things need attention:
micro-loop prevention and MRT re-calculation.</t>

<section title="Micro-forwarding loop prevention and MRTs">

<t>As is well known<xref target="RFC5715"/>, micro-loops can occur
during IGP convergence; such loops can be local to the failure or
remote from the failure.  Managing micro-loops is an orthogonal issue
to having alternates for local repair, such as MRT fast-reroute
provides.</t>

<t>There are two possible micro-loop prevention mechanisms discussed in
<xref target="RFC5715"/>.  The first is Ordered FIB <xref
target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ordered-fib"/>.  The second is Farside
Tunneling which requires tunnels or an alternate topology to reach
routers on the farside of the failure.</t>

<t>Since MRTs provide an alternate topology through which traffic can
be sent and which can be manipulated separately from the SPT, it is
possible that MRTs could be used to support Farside Tunneling.
Details of how to do so are outside the scope of this document.</t>

<t>Micro-loop mitigation mechanisms can also work when combined with
MRT.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="sec_recalculation" title="MRT Recalculation">

<t>When a failure event happens, traffic is put by the PLRs onto the
MRT topologies.  After that, each router recomputes its shortest path
tree (SPT) and moves traffic over to that.  Only after all the PLRs
have switched to using their SPTs and traffic has drained from the MRT
topologies should each router install the recomputed MRTs into the
FIBs.</t>

<t>At each router, therefore, the sequence is as follows:
<list style="numbers">
<t>Receive failure notification</t> 
<t>Recompute SPT</t> 
<t>Install new SPT</t> 
<t>If the network was stable before the failure occured, wait a
configured (or advertised) period for all routers to be using their SPTs
and traffic to drain from the MRTs.</t>
<t>Recompute MRTs</t> 
<t>Install new MRTs.</t> 
</list>
</t>

<t>While the recomputed MRTs are not installed in the FIB, protection
coverage is lowered.  Therefore, it is important to recalculate the
MRTs and install them quickly.</t>

<section title="General Issues with Area Abstraction">

<t>When a multi-homed prefix is connected in two different areas, it
may be impractical to protect them without adding the complexity of
explicit tunneling.  This is also a problem for LFA and Remote-LFA.</t>

]]></artwork>
</figure>

<t>Consider the network in <xref target="fig_mhp_areas"/> and assume
there is a richer connective topology that isn't shown, where the same
prefix is announced by ASBR X and ASBR Y which are in different
non-backbone areas.  If the link from A to ASBR X fails, then an MRT
alternate could forward the packet to ABR 1 and ABR 1 could forward it
to D, but then D would find the shortest route is back via ABR 1 to
Area 20.  This problem occurs because the routers, including the ABR,
in one area are not yet aware of the failure in a different area.</t>

<t>The only way to get it from A to ASBR Y is to explicitly tunnel it
to ASBR Y.  If the traffic is unlabeled or the appropriate MPLS labels
are known, then explicit tunneling MAY be used as long as the
shortest-path of the tunnel avoids the failure point.  In that case, A
must determine that it should use an explicit tunnel instead of an MRT
alternate.</t>
